DECO2021 - Designing For Emerging Technologies

# Unity Version 2021.3.6
No Fear Gym offers users a VR-based solution to navigate common social scenarios within a gym environment. It presents contrasting versions of social interactions, one exaggerated and tense, the other realistic and cordial. By employing virtual reality exposure therapy, it allows users to confront potential conflicts in a controlled digital space, akin to in vivo exposure. This approach enables users to practise coping strategies and emotional regulation techniques without real-world repercussions and by doing so can allow them to gain the confidence to enter a gym space without anxiety.
